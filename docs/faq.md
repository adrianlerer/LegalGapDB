# ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

## üéØ General Questions

### What is LegalGapDB?
LegalGapDB is the first open-source database documenting systematic divergences between formal law and informal practice in non-WEIRD jurisdictions. We focus on countries where written law differs significantly from legal reality.

### Why do legal gaps matter?
88% of humanity lives in countries where formal law and actual practice diverge systematically. Current Legal AI systems trained only on formal legal texts fail catastrophically when deployed in these contexts. Understanding gaps enables better AI, policy, and business decisions.

### What does "WEIRD" mean?
WEIRD stands for **Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic** societies (primarily USA, Canada, Western Europe, Australia). Most legal AI research focuses on these jurisdictions, ignoring the other 88% of humanity.

### How is this different from existing legal databases?
- **Focus on gaps**: We document divergence, not just formal law
- **Quantified data**: Specific statistics on compliance rates and enforcement
- **Causal analysis**: We explain WHY gaps persist
- **Open source**: Free access with proper licensing
- **Global scope**: Non-WEIRD jurisdictions prioritized

## üìä Data and Methodology

### How do you ensure data quality?
- **Official sources**: Government statistics, academic studies preferred
- **Peer review**: Expert validation by legal practitioners
- **Schema validation**: Automated checks for completeness
- **Citation verification**: URLs must be publicly accessible
- **Confidence levels**: All data tagged with reliability assessment

### What counts as a "legal gap"?
A legal gap requires:
1. **Formal rule**: Clear legal requirement (statute, regulation, etc.)
2. **Informal practice**: Different actual behavior with data
3. **Systematic pattern**: Not isolated incidents
4. **Quantifiable**: Statistics on compliance rates or enforcement

### Why focus on compliance rates instead of case law?
Case law shows what courts decide, but often doesn't reflect broader social reality. We're interested in how law actually functions in society, which requires empirical data on behavior and enforcement.

### How current is the data?
- **Preference**: 2023-2024 data
- **Acceptable**: 2020-2024 with explanation
- **Older data**: Only if it's the most recent available
- **Update cycle**: Cases reviewed annually for freshness

## ü§î Conceptual Questions

### Isn't non-compliance always bad?
Not necessarily! Sometimes:
- **Laws are outdated**: Technology or society changed
- **Laws are impractical**: Implementation costs exceed benefits
- **Laws conflict**: Different regulations contradict
- **Social norms differ**: Cultural practices diverge from formal law

We document reality without moral judgment.

### How is this different from corruption studies?
**Broader scope:**
- **Corruption**: Illegal behavior by officials
- **Legal gaps**: Any formal/informal divergence
- **Includes**: Resource constraints, cultural factors, economic incentives
- **Neutral perspective**: Not necessarily illegal or immoral

### What about legal pluralism?
We acknowledge multiple legal systems coexist:
- **Formal law**: State-enacted rules
- **Customary law**: Traditional practices
- **Religious law**: Faith-based systems
- **Commercial law**: Industry practices

Our focus is formal-informal gaps, but we're sensitive to legal pluralism.
